        The area around Petra has been inhabited from as early as 7000 BC,[7] and the Nabataeans might have settled in what would become the capital city of their kingdom as early as the 4th century BC.[8] Archaeological work has only discovered evidence of Nabataean presence dating back to the second century BC,[9] by which time Petra had become their capital.[7] The Nabataeans were nomadic Arabs who invested in Petra's proximity to the incense trade routes by establishing it as a major regional trading hub.
